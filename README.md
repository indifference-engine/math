# Math

C library for common mathematical operations.

## Usage

### Project Level

Your application's build pipeline will need to be configured to compile each C
file in the [src](./src) directory and recompile every C file should any H files
change.  Then, include each H file in the same directory to make its
corresponding function available.

### Assumptions

- The compilation environment supports C99.
- The `-ffp-contract=off` CFLAG is set.
- No float arguments:
  - Are NaN.
  - Are infinity.
  - Are negative infinity.
  - Cannot be cast to `int` without undefined behavior (for example, very large
    values).
