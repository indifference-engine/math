# Math

C library for common mathematical operations.

## Usage

### Project Level

Your application's build pipeline will need to be configured to compile each C
file in the [src](./src) directory and recompile every C file should any H files
change.  Then, include each H file in the same directory to make its
corresponding function available.

### Assumptions

- The compilation environment supports C99.
- No float arguments:
  - Are NaN.
  - Are infinity.
  - Are negative infinity.
  - Cannot be cast to `int` without undefined behavior (for example, very large
    values).

### Constants

| Name                | Description        |
| ------------------- | ------------------ |
| `PI`                | The value of PI.   |
| `NAN`               | Not a number.      |
| `POSITIVE_INFINITY` | Positive infinity. |
| `NEGATIVE_INFINITY` | Negative infinity. |
